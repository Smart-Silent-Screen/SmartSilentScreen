SmartSilentScreen is an Android app built with Jetpack Compose that detects the phone’s face-up/face-down orientation using virtual accelerometer sensors. The app automatically switches between silent and normal modes while logging behavior to Firebase Firestore. Features include Firebase Authentication, MVVM architecture, and clean Compose UI. Developed by Group 4 (Thai Nguyen, Adegoke Akanbi, Iurii Manastyrskyi).
